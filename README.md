# Music Metadata - Common Works Registration v2.x

This is a Python library for parsing, validation and generation of CWR 2.1 and 2.2 files. It extends the functionality of [Music Metadata - EDI](https://github.com/musicmetadata/edi).

## Common Works Registration

Common Works Registration (CWR) is a protocol and data format for the registration of musical works in collecting societies world-wide. You can find out much more about it [on developer's website](https://matijakolaric.com/articles/1/) or in the videos below.

## Features and Demo

Currently the library can parse CWR 2.x files, with file-, group-, field-, record- and most of transaction-level validation.
From there, it can be converted to HTML (visual validation), JSON, etc. There is a [DEMO](https://web-wrapper.matijakolaric.com/). The code for the demo is released as [open source](https://github.com/musicmetadata/web-wrapper).

Although this is a CWR 2.x library, the terminology is from CWR 3.x, and the output structure is the same for CWR 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and upcoming 3.1 versions.

## Release

This library has not yet been released as open source. The schedule depends on sponsors, feel free to become one!
